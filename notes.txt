1. The "Prettier" extension. Add trailing slashes. It's not marked as an error or warning in W3 Validator. However, This is something good to know. 
I avoided using that extension in order to avoid being marked as inssuficient for the W3 Validator. The extension was recommended by the insturctur itself.

2. The assessment says the following " Uses pseudo-class nth-child to color the even horizontal lines the background color #CFF and 
odd lines #FFF from a table."

I don't have any tables in my FIGMA DESIGN. So I created one below the contact section in "contact page" I know it is not part of my design. 
However, I did this to be compliant with the assessment.
